# RRT Overworld
RePixelatedMC's Remastered Terrain, Overworld Edition

**Intoduction** 
RRT Overworld is a more vanilla friendly pack while still trying to keep a good and fresh look to the overworld dimension with large mountains and a lot of place to build bases. Sadly RRT Overworld doesnt yet feature the ancient city and the ocean monument but that will be coming in the near future. But it does feature a woodland mansion.

**How to install?**
Very simple! Just run the `/iris download pack=rrtoverworld branch=main` command and the server should automatically restart after a little while if it doesnt restart it manually.

**Note**
this pack is only for __1.19.3__ and above 1.19.2 should function fine as well but with some minor tree issues. The world height is -64 - 512 also.

*Ofc it includes more then only those regions i just didnt make a picture of them.*

**Look in the future..**
If you all will like it and use it i will definitely update it and maintain it and make it look better then it currently is looking. Im planning to rework loot as well in the near future.

**Also**
If you need anything done with the iris dimension engine but you dont want to learn the engine we have #ticket-hub its a place where you can commission someone ( most likely me ) to do your idea for you! iris is capable of making custom dimensions with oraxen and items adder blocks to give your dimension a unique look! and oraxen and itemsadder are both supported in objects that you can create dunegons that include those blocks and for example let them spawn in RRT Overworld...
